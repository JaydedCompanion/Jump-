# Jump!
A simple arcade videogame aimed towards children with eyesight issues (Mainly Lazy Eye syndrome, but incompatible with colour blind patients). With a bichromatic color scheme the game forces the player to use both eyes by making certain graphics only visible to one eye, or the other.
# Gameplay
Because this project's purpose serves yourger children, the gameplay is very simplistic and easy. The game must be playable by anyone, which wouldn't be possible with more challenging gameplay, and the current game style will be prone to change
# Bichromatic Colours
This game is meant to be played with standard blue-and-red 3D glasses. Not because it has a 3D analygliph, but because the lenses make it so each eye can only see specific items. Thanks to this behaviour, the player will be forced to use both of their eyes at the same time. This has been found to help children with lazy eye syndrome, as the cause of this problem tends to be that the child is relying on one specific eye, while letting the other wander off. This causes them to have terrible depth perception, and will increase the risk of further eyesight problems in their future.
